## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, MUI, Firebase, Framer Motion, Redux

PKFit is built using React as the main front-end library, with Material UI (MUI) for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and Redux for state management. Firebase is used as the backend service for user authentication and database storage.

The application is divided into several components, including a landing page, workout generator, user plans, and user account settings. The workout generator uses an algorithm to create exercise sets and custom user preferences to generate a personalized workout plan. User plans are saved to Firebase and can be accessed through the users saved workouts.

## Optimizations

Implemented Firebase security rules to restrict read and write access to user-specific data
Used lazy loading to improve the initial load time of the application
Optimized image sizes to reduce page load times
Implemented a caching strategy to improve performance when users revisit the application

## Lessons Learned:

As a solo developer on this project, I learned a lot about the various technologies used to build PKFit, including React, Material-UI, Firebase, Framer Motion, and Redux. I gained experience in building a user authentication system using Firebase and storing user data in a NoSQL database. I also learned about responsive web design and the importance of optimizing website performance for a better user experience. Overall, this project was a great opportunity to improve my skills as a developer and learn new technologies.
